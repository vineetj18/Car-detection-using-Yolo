# Car detection using YOLO
Developed a car detection module using CNN and subsequent  ﬁltering using non max suppression to recognise cars from  dashcam footage, delivering images with the bounding boxes  around them. The implementation is based on the very  powerful YOLO(You Only Look Once) object detection  algorithm.
